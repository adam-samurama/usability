    <h1>Usability Study</h1>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p id="grey">What website did you study? Who is the target audience? What three tasks did you assign to your subjects?</p>
    <p>We studied carrefour, the target audience are kenyans or foriegners living in Kenya that want to buy items from the shop. The three tasks I assigned include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Searching for specific items.</li>
        <li>Buying items using digital pay, credit, or debit cards</li>
        <li>Seeing my recently visted items</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p id="grey">Were subjects able to complete the tasks you assigned them? Was it easy for them? How much time, or how many steps, did it take to complete the tasks?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Yes, we can search for specific items.</li>
        <li>Yes, you can buy with digital pay.</li>
        <li>Yes, it includes recently view items.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p id="grey">What did you learn from this study about the website? Is the current design effective? Why or why not? How might the site be designed differently so that users could more easily perform the representative tasks?</p>
    <p>I learned that carrefour is accessible to a lot of people that are trying to buy from the store online. The current design is effective and close to that of Amazon because it can do all the designed tasks</p>
    <p>The login should be connected to google to make it easier for people to login and shop. It executed all the assigned tasks in a simple manner.</p>
